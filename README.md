# vhdl-assistant
WHAT IS VHDL Assistant ?
VHDL Assistant is a tool that I realized in Java as a part of one of my university courses.
I used Java to realize both the UI and the tool's logic.

What is the goal of this tool ?
The goal of the project was to make a tool which would simplify the process of coding in VHDL, in particular way the structural modeling style. In a few words, VHDL Assistant allows you to insert the components you need for your module, bind the components and output the result in file (you can choose the extension accordingly to your needs). The final result is a .vhdl file with all the boiler code you need to run your simultaions.
You can find some examples in edaplayground directory.

THIS PROJECT CAN BE IMPROVED, so feel free to contribute or use the source code to create your own version of it.

I will refactor the code and improve the UI asap.
